## Tasks
1. [x] Confirm current window chrome/drag behavior and identify overlay elements that must stay clickable (HUD text, navigation buttons).
2. [x] Draft spec deltas describing a borderless, resizable window with the image/placeholder frame acting as the drag region while keeping controls no-drag.
3. [x] Implement Tauri window config and frontend drag/no-drag markers to match the spec.
4. [x] Validate with `openspec validate update-borderless-window-dragging --strict` (manual drag/resizing smoke-check still recommended on a built/dev app).
